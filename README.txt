This is the Eclipse Optimization Project.
Note that this project remains under the official Eclipse License hosted at http://www.touchofdeathproductions.com/

Please know that while we strive to produce a stable and functional core for your developmental needs, some of our builds
that we do not offer as a recommended build can and will cause issues at times. Please report these issues to us as soon
as possible so we can get into fixing them, any help you can offer us in terms of debugging this may be of use.

Also, I would like to add that we will not add every little detail you need for your own personal game, there are plenty
of tutorials to go from, and a basic understand of the engine is required to make a game worth playing to begin with. So
please leave us to it, we will decide whether a feature is worth adding or not.
